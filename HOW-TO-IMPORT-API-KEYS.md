- Your grammar lessons (OK to share)
- **Your API keys** (⚠️ PRIVATE - don't share!)

### Best Practices:
1. **Keep exported files private** (they contain your API keys)
2. **Don't upload to public GitHub/Replit** (use .gitignore)
3. **Store backups securely** (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
4. **Each user should use their own API keys**

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Import shows "0 cards" but I have cards in my file?
→ File might be corrupted. Try exporting again.

### API keys didn't import?
→ Check the success message - it will say "and API keys" if they were included
→ Verify by trying to generate a grammar lesson

### Want to import ONLY API keys, not cards?
→ Use Settings → Import instead of My Cards → Import
→ Or manually enter them in Settings → Tabs
